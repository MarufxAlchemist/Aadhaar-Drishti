## 📌 About the Project

**Aadhaar Drishti** (दृष्टि — *vision* or *perspective*) is a governance-grade analytical dashboard designed to interpret aggregate Aadhaar enrolment and update data as societal and administrative signals.

Rather than presenting raw counts, the platform applies **normalization and comparative analysis** to highlight regions and time periods exhibiting unusual update behaviour relative to enrolment baselines. These patterns can support administrative review, infrastructure planning, and operational prioritization.

The project is developed as part of the **UIDAI Hackathon 2026** and is intentionally designed as a **decision-support instrument**, not a predictive or causal system.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate how aggregate Aadhaar administrative data can be transformed into **interpretable, reproducible, and policy-relevant insights**, while maintaining strict standards of:

- ✅ **Data privacy**
- ✅ **Methodological transparency**
- ✅ **Interpretive restraint**

---

## 📊 Core Analytical Concept

### Update Friction Index (UFI)

The primary analytical construct used in Aadhaar Drishti is the **Update Friction Index (UFI)**.

UFI normalizes Aadhaar update activity against enrolment volume to enable fair comparison across regions and time periods, helping surface areas where update activity deviates from expected administrative patterns.

> **Important:**  
> UFI is treated as a **signal, not a causal explanation**. All interpretations are contextual and non-predictive.

---

## 🧱 System Design

- ✅ **Frontend-only architecture**
- ✅ **Static, read-only datasets**
- ✅ **Deterministic analytical pipeline**
- ❌ **No backend, database, authentication, or write operations**

This design mirrors common government analytics practices, prioritizing **auditability, reproducibility, and reliability** over architectural complexity.

## 🗂️ Datasets Used

| Dataset | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Aadhaar Enrolment Monthly Data** | Monthly new registrations by state/district |
| **Aadhaar Demographic Update Monthly Data** | Monthly demographic update transactions |
| **Aadhaar Biometric Update Monthly Data** | Monthly biometric update transactions |

**Source:**  
Government of India Open Data Platform ([data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in)) / UIDAI-published aggregate statistics

> **Privacy Note:**  
> All datasets are **anonymized and aggregate** in nature. No personally identifiable information (PII) is processed or inferred.

---

## 🧪 Methodology (High-Level)

1. **Explicit data loading** from static sources
2. **State- and month-level aggregation**
3. **Normalization** for cross-region comparability
4. **Identification** of temporal and regional deviations
5. **Clear documentation** of assumptions and limitations

A dedicated **Methodology & Transparency** section within the dashboard outlines interpretation boundaries to prevent over-generalization.
